# Python_For_Everybody_Solutions
These are my solutions to Python for Everybody: Exploring Data using Python 3 by Charles Severance (https://www.py4e.com/book)

Besides doing the examples of the book, I tryed to do all the exercices on my way.
I hope it can help someone else in their solutions. In Python we have more than one way to solve the same problem...
